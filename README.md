# Python ImageProcessing Project
This is a license plate indentification project, by importing matplotlib libarary and integrating image identification algorithm. This project aims to identify the license plate number by showing an adaptive identification box. This program has been optimized to set a best threshold value for higher indentification accuracy. I recommend users to run with PyCharm and import necessary libararires. 
Please run "Dectection.py" as main program to test the identification region.  
You can import new license plate images to test the accuracy and corresponding size of identification box.
